# SOFL-Maintainability-Experiment-Dataset
This repository contains the experimental datasets, materials, and analysis artifacts from our study on **quantitative maintainability assessment for SOFL formal specifications**. The dataset is directly associated with the experiments described in our paper:
> **Design and Implementation of an Automated Maintainability Assessment Tool for SOFL Formal Specifications**

---

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Context

### Experiment I â€” Case Study & Usability/Effectiveness Check
- **Participants:** 21 (formal specification experts, software engineers, graduate students)
- **Material:** 6 SOFL modules from an ATM specification
- **Goals:**  
  1) Compare **tool-computed metrics** with **expert-averaged assessments**  
  2) Collect usability feedback  
- **Outcomes:** Preliminary consistency analysis (Pearsonâ€™s *r*) and qualitative remarks

### Experiment II â€” Validation of Metrics & Rating Methodology
- **Participants:** 20 (researchers/practitioners and graduate students with SOFL/formal methods background)
- **Material:** **30 modules** from **6 SOFL specifications**  
  *ATM SYSTEM, COURSE_REGISTRATION, HOSPITAL_REGISTRATION, PUBLIC_TRANSPORT_TICKETING, STOCK_TRADING, VENDING_MACHINE*
- **Tasks:**  
  1) **Metric Quality:** Clarity, Relevance, Rationality, Coverage (5-point Likert)  
  2) **Human Validation:** Agreement with overall and per-metric tool ratings (5-point Likert)  
  3) **Importance Ranking:** Total order over 8 metrics (no ties)

Full methodology and analysis are described in the associated paper.

## ðŸ› Supporting Tool â€” SOFL-ASMAT
**SOFL-ASMAT** parses SOFL specifications and produces maintainability profiles using **eight structured metrics** and **hierarchical rating rules** :
- **Metrics:** LOE, NOP, NOCDF, CC, MHV, NODSU, EOC, EOBL  
- **Ratings:** Standardized scores and categorical bands (Aâ€“D)
